# Toxic

## Overview

This is a group project for CS273P. You can find training and test data at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data). Please download data from Keras and put them in a folder named "data" under this repo. Otherwise, you cannot run our code properly.

## External Lib

We use sklearn, keras, tensorflow, numpy and panda here. You can use the following command to install them.

    brew install numpy
    pip3 install SciPy
    pip3 install -U scikit-learn
    pip3 install keras
    pip3 install tensorflow

## Structure
We include our ipython notebook in the folder. Visualization.ipynb includes our process of visulizing given data. lstm.ipynb includes our process of build LSTM model. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest model are included in lr_dt_rf.ipynb. Those ipython notebooks also include our experiment results. 

If you cannot run ipython notebook, we provide pure python file as well with the same file name.

## Acknowledge

This project is done by Ruiyuan Zhu and Jingchen Cao. Zhu completed the data analysis and neural network part. Cao completed the linear regression, decision tree and random forest part. We write the report together.
